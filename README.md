# scripters-war-multiplayer
Based off of Scripters War tutorials, but the code is entirely written by me

Players can shoot bullets and kill other players to increase their score. They can change map and will see players who are playing on that specific map. They can chat with each other through the chat box and can send DMs to other players through the DM box by typing `@name`.
